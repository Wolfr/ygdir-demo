Documentation website for Ygdir, the minimalist CSS framework.

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/ygdir .

## Development

The repo uses Sapper:

    npm install
    npm run dev

## Next steps in framework development

### Documentation

* [ ] Implement improved design for documentation
* [ ] Document more components

### Get people to start using Ygdir!

We need first movers to start using Ygdir for the CSS of their project. Ideally, small projects to start with.

We can help by code reviewing your CSS so that it follows “Ygdir” standards. We will only do this for open source projects. Open an issue on this repo to start the confirmation.

We want to start with verifying the CSS logic for 3 different projects.

* [ ] Verified CSS logic for project 1
* [ ] Verified CSS logic for project 2
* [ ] Verified CSS logic for project 3

We will document the conversations around this and they will help to feed the discussion around Ygdir.
